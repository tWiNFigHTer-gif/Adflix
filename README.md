Project Description
We’ve all been there — just as the story gets good, an ad pops up. But what if we removed the boring “story” part altogether and gave you only the ads? Welcome to AdFlix, the world’s first “all-ads” streaming platform. It’s Netflix… if Netflix was raised by marketing executives and had no moral compass.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People keep wasting hours watching actual entertainment. Meanwhile, ads — the real unsung heroes of the internet — are treated like annoying side notes. We believe ads deserve the spotlight, the stage, the entire show.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
AdFlix puts ads front and center. You want to watch something? Smile for the camera — literally. Earn AdCoins for every ad you survive, unlock even more ads, and get showered with confetti for your questionable dedication. Bonus: every third ad is about ads.

Technical Details
For Software:

Languages: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Frontend: Raw, untamed Vanilla JavaScript (because frameworks are too nice)

AI/ML: face-api.js for smile detection

Libraries: Morgan, CORS, face-api.js

Tools: VS Code, GitHub, npm, Chrome DevTools

For Hardware:

None — we didn’t want to build a physical “Ad Viewing Machine” (yet).

Project Documentation
What It Actually Does:

Uses AI to detect your smile before playing an ad (no smile = no ad, no joy).

Gives you AdCoins for each ad you watch — 2 coins per ad, because you deserve something.

Unlocks more ads at certain coin milestones (10, 20, 35, 50).

Confetti party every 5 ads, because your brain needs some dopamine to keep going.

Every third ad is literally about ads.

Screenshots:

A Netflix-style UI… but instead of shows, it’s just ads.


Smile or else. No exceptions.


Confetti for your suffering. You earned it.

Diagrams:

Frontend, backend, AI… all working together to waste your time.


From “click” → “smile” → “ads” → “why did I do this?”
