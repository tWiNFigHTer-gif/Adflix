// server.js
// Rebuilt backend for the Useless AdFlix project.
// This server is designed to be simple, clear, and reliably unreliable.

// --- Dependencies ---
const express = require('express'); // The web server framework
const cors = require('cors'); // Middleware to allow requests from the frontend
const path = require('path'); // Node.js module for handling file paths
const morgan = require('morgan'); // Middleware for logging HTTP requests

// --- Server Configuration ---
const app = express();
const PORT = 3000;

// --- Middleware Setup ---

// 1. CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): Allows our frontend (running on a different port)
//    to make API requests to this backend.
app.use(cors());

// 2. Morgan Logger: Logs incoming requests to the console for easy debugging.
//    The 'dev' format is concise and colorful.
app.use(morgan('dev'));

// 3. Static File Server: Serves video files directly. Any request to '/videos/...'
//    will look for a file in the 'videos' folder in the same directory.
app.use('/videos', express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'videos')));


// --- In-Memory "Database" of Ads ---
// This JSON object mimics a database of ads, categorized like Netflix shows.
// It's designed to be easily extendable.
